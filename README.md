- **Post Deletion**: Only the **creator of a post** can delete it.  
- **Secure API**: Input validation and request handling are managed with **Joi and Celebrate**.  
- **Server-Side Security**: The back-end includes **NGINX, Certbot (SSL), PM2 for process management, and UFW for firewall security**.  

## 🎯 Objective
